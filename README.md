# Spring, Hibernate SpringBoot course
This course helps me get a better understanding of Spring framework and MVC design pattern using both annotations and XML approach, but also dives into JDBC, Hibernate and Spring Boot later on.

I have also made use of Maven for dependency installation, Tomcat for server deployment, MySQL Workbench for database quick management.
More info soon !
